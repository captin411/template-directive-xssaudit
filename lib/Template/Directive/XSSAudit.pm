=head1 NAME

Template::Directive::XSSAudit - TT2 output filtering lint testing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Template;
  use Template::Directive::XSSAudit;

  my $tt = Template->new({
      FACTORY => "Template::Directive::XSSAudit"
  });

  my $input = <<'END';
  Hello [% exploitable.goodness %] World!
  How would you like to [% play.it.safe | html %] today?
  END

  my $out  = '';
  $tt->process(\$input, {}, \$out) || die $tt->error();

  # output on STDOUT... via default on_error handler
  # see the documentation of on_error for explanation of the
  # output format of the default error handler
  \tline:\tNO_FILTERS\texploitable.goodness\t[]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module will help you perform basic lint tests of your template toolkit
files. 

It is intended to parse through all GET items, and make sure that at least
one "good" filter is used to escape it.

A callback may be provided so that the errors may be handled in a way that
makes sense for the project at hand.  See C<on_error> for more details.

There is another callback which can be provided named C<on_filtered>. This is
triggered when a variable is successfully filtered.  By default there is
no implementation.  See C<on_filtered> for more details.

Additionally, a list of filter names may be provided, instructing the module
to require that certain filters be used for output escaping in the tests.

Have a look at the t/*.t files that come with the distribution as they
leverage the C<on_error()> callback routine.

=head1 IMPORTANT NOTES ON SECURITY

This tool is NOT a substitude for code and security reviews as it is NOT
context aware. This means if you use a html filter in javascript context
or css context or html attribute context, you would not be escaping things
properly and this tool would not catch that.  

You also need to make sure that your "good" filters are actually doing their
job and escaping things properly.

All of this to say, don't let this give you a false sense of security.

=head1 EXPORTS

None.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item Template::Directive::XSSAudit->on_error ( [ coderef ] )

This method is called on every variable involved in a template
toolkit 'GET' which was not filtered properly. 

The callback will be executed in one of two cases:

 - The variable in question has NO output filtering
 - The variable is filtered but none of the filters 
   were found in the C<good_filter> list.

A default implementation is provided which will simply C<warn> any
problems which are found with the following information (tab delimited):

  <file_name> line:<line_no>    <error_type>    [<filters used csv>]

If you call this method without a subroutine reference, it will simply
return you the current implementation.

If you provide your own callback, it will be passed one parameter 
which is a hash reference containing the following keys.

=over 4

=item variable_name

This is a string represending the variable name which was found to be
incorrectly escaped.

=item filtered_by

This will contain an array reference containing the names of the filters which
were applied to the variable name.

If there are entries in this list, it means that no filter in the
good filter list was found to apply to the variable.  See C<good_filter> for
more information.

In the case of variables with no filters, this will be an empty array
reference.

=item file_name

The line number in the template file where the problem occurred.

This is parsed out as best as can be done but it may come back as an empty
string in many cases.  It is a convenience item and should not be relied on
for any sort of automation.

=item file_line

The line number in the template file where the problem occurred.

This is parsed out as best as can be done but it may come back as an empty
string in many cases.  It is a convenience item and should not be relied on
for any sort of automation.

    my $class = shift;
    my ($callback) = @_;
    if( $callback ) {
        if( ref($callback) ne "CODE" ) {
            croak("argument to on_error must be a subroutine reference"); 
        }
        $_error_handler = $callback;
    }
    return $_error_handler;
}

=over 4

=item Template::Directive::XSSAudit->on_filtered ( [ coderef ] )

This method is called on every variable involved in a template
toolkit 'GET' which was filtered satisfactorily. 

By default, no implementation is given so if you want this to
do anything, you'll have to provide a coderef yourself.

The callback and function works just like C<on_error> so see the
documentation for that method for more details.

    my $class = shift;

        }
        $_ok_handler = $callback;
    }
    return $_ok_handler;
    
}

=over 4

=item Template::Directive::XSSAudit->good_filters ( [ arrayref ] )

This method will return the current list of "good" filters to you
as an array reference. eg.

  [ 'html', 'uri' ]

If you pass an array reference of strings, it will also set the list of good
filters.  The defaults are simply 'html' and 'uri' but I will be adding more
int the future.
